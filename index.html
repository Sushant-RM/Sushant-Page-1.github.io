    <section id="space-time-efficiency">
    <h2>Space and Time Efficiency & Order of Growth</h2>
    <h3>Space Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Space efficiency refers to how much memory an algorithm uses. Imagine you're packing for a trip:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficient Packing: You only take essentials, so your luggage is light.</li>
        <li>Inefficient Packing: You pack everything, making it hard to carry.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Time Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Time efficiency refers to how fast an algorithm completes its task. Think of it like a race:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficient Algorithm: A fast runner finishing quickly.</li>
        <li>Inefficient Algorithm: A slow runner, especially with more work (bigger input).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Order of Growth</h3>
    <p>Order of growth measures how an algorithm's time or memory usage changes as input size increases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>O(1): Constant time. E.g., Accessing the first item in a list.</li>
        <li>O(n): Linear time. E.g., Searching a book by checking each one.</li>
        <li>O(n²): Quadratic time. E.g., Nested operations like comparing every student.</li>
        <li>O(log n): Logarithmic time. E.g., Binary search in a dictionary.</li>
        <li>O(2ⁿ): Exponential time. E.g., Solving a puzzle doubling in possibilities.</li>
    </ul>

        
        <section id="efficiency">
    <h4>How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</h4>
    <p>To determine the most efficient approach, I assess the time and space complexity of the solution. For example, in sorting algorithms, comparing options like Quick Sort (O(n log n)) and Bubble Sort (O(n²)) helps to decide which is the more efficient approach for a large dataset.</p>
</section>

        
    <h2>Takeaways from Design Principles</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Divide and Conquer</h3>
    <p>Divide a big problem into smaller parts, solve each, and combine results.</p>
    <p>Example: Merge Sort divides and merges sorted lists.</p>

    <section id="breaking-down-problem">
    <h3>Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</h3>
    <p>Breaking down a problem into smaller parts makes it easier to manage and solve. For example, in Divide and Conquer approaches like Merge Sort, the problem is split into smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved independently before merging the results.</p>
</section>

    
    <h3>2. Greedy Strategy</h3>
    <p>Make the best possible decision at each step, assuming it leads to the optimal solution.</p>
    <p>Example: Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds shortest paths by choosing the nearest node.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Dynamic Programming</h3>
    <p>Save results of smaller problems to reuse them and avoid recalculating.</p>
    <p>Example: Fibonacci Sequence uses stored results for efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Backtracking</h3>
    <p>Explore all solutions, backtracking if one path fails, to try others.</p>
    <p>Example: N-Queens Problem places queens on a chessboard without conflict.</p>
        <section id="limitations">
    <h4>How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</h4>
    <p>Identifying limitations often involves considering edge cases, scalability, and performance. For example, the naive solution for the N-Queens problem might not scale well, requiring backtracking to address potential conflicts and ensure a solution is found.</p>
</section>


        <section id="simplicity-vs-optimization">
    <h3>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</h3>
    <p>Simplicity is prioritized when the problem is small or the solution needs to be easily understood and maintained. For example, using Linear Search for small datasets might be simpler and more readable than implementing Binary Search, even though Binary Search is more optimized.</p>
</section>


    <h2>Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Hierarchical Data</h3>
    <p>Hierarchical data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Family Trees: Representing family relationships.</li>
        <li>Company Hierarchies: Roles and departments.</li>
        <li>File Systems: Directories and files on a computer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Tree Structures</h3>
    <p>Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes. The top node is the root, and the bottom nodes are leaves. Types include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Binary Search Tree (BST)</b>: Left child < smaller value; Right child > larger value.</li>
        <li><b>AVL Tree</b>: Self-balancing BST ensuring height balance.</li>
        <li><b>Red-Black Tree</b>: A BST with red/black nodes to maintain balance.</li>
        <li><b>Heap</b>: Complete binary tree with Max-Heap (Parent > children) or Min-Heap (Parent < children).</li>
        <li><b>Trie</b>: A prefix tree for string storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Array Query Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Array query algorithms focus on efficiently answering specific questions or finding elements within an array.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary Search: Efficient search on sorted arrays.</li>
        <li>Prefix Sum: Pre-computing sums to answer range queries quickly.</li>
        <li>Sliding Window: Efficiently computing results over a moving window in an array.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tree vs. Graphs and Their Traversals</h2>
    
    <h3>Tree</h3>
    <p>A connected, acyclic graph with a unique path between any two nodes. Traversals include pre-order, in-order, and post-order.</p>
    
    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <p>A collection of vertices connected by edges, which may have cycles. Graph traversal methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>BFS (Breadth-First Search): Explores nodes level by level.</li>
        <li>DFS (Depth-First Search): Explores nodes deeply before backtracking.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Applications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Trees: Used in decision-making, file systems, and databases (e.g., B-trees for indexing).</li>
        <li>Graphs: Employed in network analysis, social networks, and route optimization.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
    
    <h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they’re in the wrong order.</li>
        <li>Insertion Sort: Inserts elements into their correct position.</li>
        <li>Merge Sort: Divides the array and merges subarrays.</li>
        <li>Quick Sort: Partitions the array and recursively sorts subarrays.</li>
        <li>Heap Sort: Builds a heap and extracts sorted elements.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Searching Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Search: Checks each element sequentially.</li>
        <li>Binary Search: Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by halving the search range.</li>
    </ul>
        <section id="trade-offs">
    <h4>Reflect on the trade-offs while choosing between different approaches to solve a problem.</h4>
    <p>When choosing between different approaches, there are trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity. For example, Quick Sort is faster (O(n log n)) but uses more memory due to recursion, while Merge Sort uses less memory but is also slower in practice for small datasets.</p>
</section>

        <section id="criteria">
    <h4>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</h4>
    <p>The effectiveness of a solution can be evaluated based on several criteria: time efficiency (how quickly the algorithm executes), space efficiency (how much memory is required), and how well it handles edge cases. For instance, Binary Search is effective because it reduces search time from O(n) to O(log n) for sorted arrays.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Graph Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Graph algorithms deal with problems involving graphs like finding shortest paths, spanning trees, and connectivity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.</li>
        <li>Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Finds shortest paths even with negative weights.</li>
        <li>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Calculates shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.</li>
        <li>Prim's Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.</li>
    </ul>
        <section id="innovation-vs-tradition">
    <h4>How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</h4>
    <p>Innovation is necessary when traditional solutions don’t scale, or the problem involves new, complex requirements. For example, Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a tried-and-tested solution for shortest path problems, but for graphs with negative weights, Bellman-Ford Algorithm may be more appropriate, requiring a more innovative approach.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Importance of Graph Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Graph algorithms are essential in solving real-world problems such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spanning Trees</b>: Connects all vertices with the fewest edges, found using Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms.</li>
        <li><b>Shortest Paths</b>: Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms find the shortest paths, useful in GPS systems and network routing.</li>
        <li><b>Connectivity</b>: Identifying whether a graph is connected, or if there is a path between two nodes.</li>
    </ul>
